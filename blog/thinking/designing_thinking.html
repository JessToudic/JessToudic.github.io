                &emsp; <i>Warning: This blog post is a collection of thoughts I wrote down as a 
                brain dump when I couldn’t sleep at 1am (because I was thinking too 
                much about thinking). It’s got a lot of points that I want to make, but 
                I don’t think I make them very well. Hopefully the gist is there though! 
                I have tried to make them somewhat coherent, but if they don’t flow overly well, 
                you now know why!</i>
            </p>
            <h1>Introduction.</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp; How often do you think about how you are thinking? Are you using an 
                internal dialogue (speaking to yourself in your head)? Are you picturing 
                things in your mind? If you didn’t have an immediate answer to any of these 
                questions, I invite you to ponder why that is the case. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; We are all so used to our own way of thinking, that it often doesn’t occur 
                to us that other people may think in a completely different way. I’m not 
                talking about the content of a thought (e.g. ‘this apple is yummy’), I’m 
                talking about what is actually occurring in our minds when we think that. 
                Some people do not have the ability to internally ‘talk to themselves’. 
                Some people are unable to ‘see’ anything in their mind at all (known as 
                aphantasia). Does this surprise you? Maybe one of these describes you, and 
                you find it baffling that some people <i>can</i> do these things.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; If this did surprise you, you’re not alone! I was in my third year of 
                university when I found out that some people lack an internal dialogue; 
                until then, I had assumed that everyone naturally develops an internal dialogue 
                as they grow up, as part of language development. It never occurred to me that 
                some people do not have the ability to entertain themselves when spending time 
                alone by conversing with themself (how boring!). 
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; I was initially baffled as to how people who lack such an internal dialogue function. 
                Then, I became perplexed by the fact that I had been surrounded by individuals 
                who lack an internal dialogue or have aphantasia, and never before realised it. 
                The fact that their internal world was so different to mine but they could live 
                a similar lifestyle to me, and that these changes were not apparent from outside, 
                was incredible to me. I read many blog posts (like 
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blake/posts/10156834777480504" target="_blank">this one</a>) 
                and watched countless 
                YouTube videos interviewing individuals lacking these 
                two traits. Not to mention asking all fellow students I came across whether they 
                were as shocked as I was about this!
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; After living in a state of bafflement for a while, my bewilderment turned into shock 
                at the fact that it had taken me until the age of 20 to learn that some individuals 
                lack an internal dialogue or mental imagery. I felt ignorant for having lived so 
                long being unaware that others around me thought so differently!
            </p>
            <h1>Education.</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp; My thoughts soon turned to the education system: the reason it took me so long to 
                gain this awareness was that at no point in my education had I been taught about 
                the differences in the way people think. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; Wouldn’t knowledge of the extremes in terms of the way people think help us 
                considerably in education? If education was based on transferring knowledge into 
                specific types of minds rather than just explaining knowledge, would it not be 
                far more effective? That is, if the way students thought (about the knowledge/what 
                they should do in their mind when thinking about the knowledge) was placed at the 
                front of mind when planning a lesson or lecture - tailored towards different thinking 
                styles - would it not be received far more successfully?
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; I remember being given ‘What type of learner am I?’ quizzes in primary school, 
                which provided answers such as ‘visual’ (learn with pictures), ‘auditory’ (learn 
                by listening) and ‘kinesthetic’ (learn by doing). Our answers never resulted in 
                any change to our teaching or lessons. Moreover, at no point was it explained that 
                we may receive different answers from our friends because we literally think in a 
                completely different way! For example, it was never explained to us that some people 
                were better at learning from pictures because they were able to create more vivid 
                and detailed pictures in their mind, whereas others who didn’t learn very well from 
                pictures may be unable to create any mental imagery at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; Surely it would make a lot of sense to teach children that people think in very 
                different ways. Not only would this help them understand the most effective ways 
                for themselves to learn, but it would also open the children’s minds to individual 
                differences and what they may be more naturally skilled at. Instead of setting 
                children in school based on ability, we could set them based on thinking style so 
                that lessons could be tailored accordingly. That is, we could tailor education to 
                the way individuals’ minds work. (A caveat with this, though, is that children’s 
                brains, and therefore potentially their thinking styles, are still developing.)
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; Given that the point of education is to transfer knowledge from one mind into another, 
                would a focus on what the receiving mind is doing to think about the topic of interest, 
                and how the knowledge is being represented in the receiver’s mind, not make sense as a 
                primary interest? It intrigues me as to why the ‘teaching’ seems to involve the 
                transfer of knowledge from one mind to a delivery format, with little regard as to 
                what the receiving minds are doing on receipt. Is this because those teaching blindly 
                assume that the minds they are teaching to will think in the same way as them? Were 
                the teachers also ignorant of the range in which different minds think? Or is it 
                because catering to a vast selection of minds in one lesson would be too difficult; 
                a single lesson is simply more convenient to deliver.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; When we are taught, it seems assumed that we already know how to think about the knowledge. 
                The primary aim seems to be to present the knowledge, but surely the knowledge would be 
                far better transferred into the recipient's minds if the lessons also taught how to think 
                about the knowledge? A great example is my mathematics degree: I had absolutely no idea 
                how to think about all of the symbols on the page, and spent ages trying to figure this out; 
                it wasn’t until recently that I 
                <a href="/blog/thinking/analysis.html">learnt that turning theorems into images</a>
                could be extremely helpful! I ended up spending most of my maths degree pondering how I should be thinking 
                about maths, rather than thinking about the maths. This would have been an entirely 
                different story had the lectures addressed our minds, rather than simply lecturing 
                content. Teaching knowledge in parallel with how to think about the knowledge would 
                be incredible. 
            </p>
            <h1>Mental Health Treatment</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp; Just as the way thinking works does not seem like the primary focus of education, 
                it too does not seem like the primary focus of mental health treatment. Take CBT for 
                example: a talking therapy that identifies and challenges negative thought patterns 
                and behaviour, used to treat anxiety and depression. It is highly regarded as the most 
                effective treatment for numerous mental health disorders, and yet it still only seems 
                to consider the content of thoughts, not the substance/structure of them in the mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; When reading literature to understand treatments for mental health disorders, I 
                remember being baffled by how little focus was put on how thinking worked. Why was 
                this not the starting point, given that it is the mind and thoughts that need to be 
                addressed? If treatment began with an explanation of how thinking works, and if this 
                was used to address how thinking can be effectively healed, then the patient could 
                understand what they need to be doing in their mind to effectively recover. Instead, 
                the literature began at a behavioural level, delved into the ‘changing their thinking’ 
                level, but never got to the crucial ‘employing how thinking works’ level.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; I decided that perhaps the reason for this was because the ‘how does thinking work’ 
                remains an unsolved question. But then I realised that treatments are ‘outside-in’: 
                it is professionals on the ‘outside’ of the patients’ minds, who are blind to the 
                way the minds are thinking, trying to come up with treatments. They are observing 
                the behaviour of the patient, but are unable to know what the mind is doing; a 
                fundamental problem with mental health treatments. When research for treatments began, 
                all professionals had at their disposal was behaviour observation. No wonder a 
                focus on the substance of the thoughts of the patient, and how their thinking works, 
                is not the core of treatments. As understanding of the brain and mind has increased, 
                some of this knowledge has been integrated into treatments. However, it still 
                hasn’t quite got to the ‘employing how thinking works’ stage, and is certainly not putting 
                this at the forefront.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; Would considering how the mind works, and getting a patient to understand that 
                and use it to their advantage in recovery, not be advantageous? Even if the big 
                question of ‘how thinking works’ has not been answered, there does exist some 
                research which at least provides a partial answer. For example, using just two 
                properties of thoughts (combinatorial and associative) I was able to create (for 
                <a href="/blog/maths/dynamics_on_hypergraphs.html">my dissertation</a>) 
                a simple model of thinking that could in theory - with a lot of 
                work - be used to help individuals understand how to use their thoughts to address 
                maladaptive thought patterns. I believe that bridging research about how thinking 
                works with mental health treatments could be highly fruitful for their efficacy.
            </p>
            <h1>
                What do you do in your mind when you think about __?
            </h1>
            <p>
                &emsp; Realising that the substance of others’ thoughts can be so different to mine, 
                I started to question what other people do in their minds when they think about 
                certain things, such as 
                <a href="/blog/thinking/arithmetic.html">arithmetic</a> or 
                <a href="/blog/thinking/time.html">time</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; The range of answers I received got me thinking: is there such a thing as the 
                ‘optimal’ way to think about something? For example, when solving a double-digit 
                multiplication problem, what is the most efficient thing to be doing in my mind 
                to reach the answer as quickly as possible? Or when thinking about time, is 
                having a ‘mental calendar’ where events are placed on it more efficient than just 
                having a picture of an empty calendar in your mind and using a physical one? 
                Could these ways of thinking be taught?
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; We’ve probably all developed our own way of thinking about certain things that 
                work for us, but is there a better way? You may think that it is not possible to 
                change the way you think about something, but consider this: when I tell you to 
                think about an apple, is what you do in your mind consistent, or has it changed 
                over time?
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; If we were able to research and determine optimal ways of thinking about things 
                by collating many people’s ways of thinking about certain topics or concepts, 
                then these findings could be taught and enhance the lives of us all!
            </p>
            <h1>Conclusion.</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp; This gets me to the crux of this post: the potential to design our thinking: 
                ‘thinking design’. We could collate many people’s ways of thinking about certain topics 
                or concepts to research and determine optimal ways of thinking about them. By designing 
                our thinking to optimise for the task at hand, we could use our minds to their full 
                potential. No longer will people be stuck not understanding how to think about something, 
                as this effort will have already been solved. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp; If this has got you thinking, let me know! And if you’ve got any links to existing 
                ‘thinking design’ research, I’d love to connect! (Maybe ‘thinking design’ is out 
                there with a completely different name that I’m unaware of!)
